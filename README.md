In this repository you will find projects related to Machine Learning. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is be to used as a learning resource and a way to lookup problems to solve specific problems.
If you got any questions or suggestions, feel free to ask convey them.

This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something then I'd happily merge a PR ðŸ˜ƒ.
